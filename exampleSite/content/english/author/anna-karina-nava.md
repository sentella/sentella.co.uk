A hands-on, highly-committed backend engineer with experience designing, building, integrating, testing and deploying software across a variety of platforms.

My engineering background, along with strong business acumen has always made me a principal consultant to grow more business, starting with my own effort all the way to motivating my peers.

Passionate about making sure solutions meet the business needs while keeping them future proof.

Iâ€™m always enthusiastic about learning new technologies and programming languages.

The kind of person who gets things done.
